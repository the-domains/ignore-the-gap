Getting sidetracked by the Technology

When we study making websites and apps we too often focus on the technology at hand rather than the task. Just because the Web Application you are writing uses Angular doesn't mean that it all has to be done the Angular way. That notion invalidates all the things you learned before you started using Angular, and it assumes that nothing of interest happens outside the Angular worldview.

When you are using Bootstrap CSS doesn't mean that everything has to be placed using the grid system. You still have a very capable layout engine in CSS at your disposal.

Software is a victim of technology. We think it is about technology, but it's about people. It's about managing our habits of thinking and avoid the traps we fall into.

The Agile process for instance tries to pull us out of some of these traps by creating a process that forces us to deal head on with some of the pitfalls. Unfortunately there are many more for which we have no process.

It's time to find a process for dealing with 'Technology Blindness'.
